<h1>code balance</h1>

<blockquote>...if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard
them as "lines produced" but as "lines spent"...<br>
&mdash; Dijkstra</blockquote>

<p>This visualization shows the accumulated effects of my changes to
the tree.</p>

<p>Time flows down.  Each bar represents a commit. Red shows added
lines, green removed lines.  Each bar is centered at the cumulative
added/removed count from my commits: the first bar is centered at 0,
and if it net added code, the next bar is shifted accordingly.</p>

<p>Commits that added and removed the same number of lines are elided,
as are commits that had &gt;1000 adds or deletes (those typically were
imports or removals of large third-party modules)..</p>
