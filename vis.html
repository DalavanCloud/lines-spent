<h1>code balance</h1>

<blockquote>...if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard
them as "lines produced" but as "lines spent"...<br>
&mdash; Dijkstra</blockquote>

<p>This visualization shows the accumulated effects of my changes to
the tree.</p>

<p>Each bar represents a commit. Red shows added lines, green removed lines.
Each bar is centered at the cumulative added/removed count from my commits:
the leftmost bar is centered at 0, and if it net added code, the next bar
is raised accordingly.</p>

<p>Commits that added and removed the same number of lines are elided.</p>
